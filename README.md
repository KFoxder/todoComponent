#Todo List
##by Kevin Fox


###Requirements:

	•	The initial state should be an empty input box, and an ADD button.
	•	If the user enters input text to the box, clicking ADD should add that text to a list.
	•	There should be a way to delete a list element.
	•	On form submit, the list elements should be submitted as an array.
	•	You should be able to have more than one component per page.

Please use only straight HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Do not use any CSS frameworks or external Javascript libraries.

###Additions:

	•	Does not accept empty or white space input
	•	Does not accept illegal characters defined by (/[^a-zA-Z0-9_-\s]/g)
	⁃	Decided to alert user when add is being pressed, not on change in the input since I wanted to keep the load on the browser at a minimal. Trade off is better performance for a slightly worse(debatable) user experience. 
	•	Kept design to minimal sleek look
	•	Minified and uglified Javascript and minified CSS
